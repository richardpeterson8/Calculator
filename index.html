                        Your interest in your research questions will help you maintain focus on the dissertation process. The work you do may become the starting place for future research work and the next step in your career. Choose a topic that interests you and will help you advance your career. However, your choice of topic will depend on the requirements of your university. Review any documents or handbooks that outline the requirements and expectations.
                        <h1>Strategies:</h1>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Examine the requirements, expectations, and methods used by your department, program, and advisor.</li>
                            <li>Review completed dissertations in your field, those done by students in your program, with your advisor, and on similar topics.</li>
                            <li>Set up a system for organizing your search results, citations, PDFs, primary sources, notes etc. using citation management tools (e.g. Zotero, Mendeley, EndNote) or other strategies. You can use these tools to create "in-text" citations and bibliographies or works cited lists as you write.</li>
                            <li>Do a preliminary study of the literature related to your topics to understand previous research, key themes, issues, variables, methodologies, limitations, terminology, controversies, and gaps in the current research. Identify significant researchers and scholars working in the area. Consult a variety of sources such as websites, research blogs, books, journal articles, conferences, organizations, and other sources.</li>
                            <li>Narrow your ideas to 2 or 3 possible research questions. Evaluate your question using criteria like feasibility, scope (too narrow or too broad), your level of interest, and future benefit to your career.</li>
                            <li>The Library has many print and ebooks on the process of writing dissertations. Search for: dissertations, academic; academic writing dissertations and report writing dissertations.</li>

                        <p>The research design is the strategy or blueprint for the collection, measurement, and analysis of your data. Generally, the design is the overall logical structure for your project and the methodology refers to the detailed steps for data collection and analysis. The type of design and method used is determined by the nature of your research question. Certain research designs and methods are core to specific fields of study or programs. Your design needs to be consistent with the requirements and expectations of your advisor, committee, and program.</p>

                        <p>The results section of your dissertation is the place to report your findings based on the data you gathered. This section should appear in a logical sequence based on your methodology. State your findings without interpretation.</p>

As part of the discussion, incorporate elements of your literature review and describe the significance and implications of what you found.</p>

                            <li>Include your research questions identified in the introduction. Describe how you have moved the field forward. Explain how your research enhances or fills a gap in existing research. Identify any unexpected or contradictory findings.</li>

                        <p>Although editing and revising occurs throughout the writing process, budget sufficient time to return to your draft for full-scale revision. Seeking feedback, reviewing, and editing your document helps you to:</p>

                        <ol>
                            <li>Separate large-scale revision from small-scale editing and proofreading, making sure to make large changes in organisation and content first rather than spending hours smoothing out a sentence you will end up cutting.</li>
                            <li>
                                Ask colleagues and others for specific types of feedback to guide the comments. Connect with your dissertation support network and members of your committee to receive constructive feedback.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Help your readers help you by giving them a direction, for example in a cover letter, in which you explain what you want to accomplish in the draft and list your specific questions and concerns.</li>
                                    <li>Identify potential readers' expertise and skills when deciding which parts of your dissertation you want them to review. For example, perhaps only people working in your lab can constructively comment on your "methods," while friends in other disciplines would give useful feedback on the "introduction."</li>
                                    <li>Respond to all comments even though you may decide to not incorporate a suggestion.</li>

                        <p>Your defence is your final opportunity to present your dissertation as a coherent, intelligent product to the committee members who will read and evaluate it. Moreover, although the defence is a challenging prospect, remember it is your chance to share your work with interested colleagues, who will give you valuable feedback.</p>

                            <li>You may or may not be expected to give a brief presentation at the beginning.</li>
                            <li>Focus on the needs of your primary audience (your advisor and committee), either by consulting them directly or considering their feedback to your initial draft.</li>
                            <li>Review your notes and rationale for making the decisions you made in your draft for example, including or excluding certain seminal theories, authors, and research methodologies.</li>
                            <li>Remind yourself that at this point you are now the "expert" on your research and the goal of the defence is to present and share your expertise and seek feedback from interested readers.</li>
